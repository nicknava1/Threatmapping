<h1>Visualizing Threats using Microsoft Sentinel

<h2>Project Description</h2>

In this project, I use PowerShell to export geographical data from failed login attempts into my Log Analytics Workspace. Finally, I use Microsoft Sentinel to create a threatmap and geolocate our attackers. In my previous project, I set up a mini SOC and honeypot to attract threat actors. This honeypot is our bait so we can obtain the necessary log information for our PowerShell script. Let's get started.

[Click here to see how I set up the SOC and Honeypot used in this project.](https://github.com/nicknava1/Soc-Honeypot)

<h2>Skills and Tools used</h2>

- PowerShell Scripting
- [IPgeolocation API](https://app.ipgeolocation.io/login)
- Microsoft Azure (Sentinel SIEM tool, Log Analytics Workspace, Virtual Machine)
- Log Analysis
- Windows 10 pro 22H2 x64 (Remote Desktop, Event Viewer)

<h2>Extracting Geographical Data from Failed Login attempts</h2>

My desktop computer is currently connected to the Honeypot using Windows Remote Desktop. I open up event viewer so I can view security events occurring on the Virtual Machine. As you can see below, I also make a unique security log by attempting to sign into the device remotely with the account name "nickfail".

By inspecting the event properties, I can see the source network address that causes this security log. This IP Address information should be in every audit failure that occurs on this device. Unfortunately for would-be hackers, I can use this information to figure out their location. Using this IPgeolocation API, which you can get limited access to for free, inside a PowerShell script will enable me to create a custom log file I can upload into Azure.

After creating my account, I am given my own unique API access code. The code you will see in this tutorial is no longer working, so you will have to get your own if you intend to duplicate this project. Now I load up PowerShell inside of the VM.

The full script is viewable [HERE](https://github.com/nicknava1/Threatmapping/blob/main/Log_Collector.ps1). When I run this script it will create a custom log file called "failed_rdp.log". Inside, it will document identifying geographic data about every failed login attempt on this device. This includes: Source IP address, State, Country, Latitude and Longitude. Let's run it now.

It's working! The purple text at the bottom of the screen shows the log information being recorded into "failed_rdp.log". We can see attempts from all of the world already! Let's check out that custom log file.

The script is doing its job and collecting the geographical data we need to upload into our Log Analytics Workspace (LAW). Now I'm going to take us back over to my desktop and load up Azure.

<h2>Importing Custom Logs into Sentinel</h2>

In my Azure client, I navigate to the Log Analytics Workspace I set up earlier. Then I create a custom log table. The collection path needed to match the directory where my "failed_rdp.log" is located on the VM.

Now that my custom table is created, I can search for the log data using my custom log name inside of the LAW. We should see the latitudes and longitudes generated by my PowerShell script.

With log data from my VM being collected into Azure, it is time to bring it all together in Microsoft Sentinel. Im going to create a SIEM query using our custom log name and specify the information I want Sentinel to extract.

Finally, I'll specify that I want it to visualize this information as a map.

Now our Threat Map is complete! We can see that most of the attacks are coming from Delhi and Florida. This visual data can provide important insides to stakeholders for create security and risk management decisions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In this project, I employed a combination of PowerShell scripting, IP geolocation APIs, and Microsoft Azure services to enhance our security measures through threatmapping using Microsoft Sentinel. By extracting geographical data from failed login attempts and visualizing them on a threatmap, we gained valuable insights into the origins of potential security threats.

The process began with setting up a mini SOC and honeypot to attract and capture threat actor activities, providing us with the necessary log information for analysis. Leveraging PowerShell scripts, we extracted vital geographic data from these logs, including source IP addresses, states, countries, and coordinates.

With the collected data, we imported it into our Log Analytics Workspace (LAW) in Azure, enabling us to centrally manage and analyze the information. We then utilized Microsoft Sentinel to create a SIEM query to extract specific details from our custom logs and visualize them on a map.

The resulting threat map provided a clear visualization of attack origins, highlighting areas of concern such as Delhi and Florida in our case. This visual representation equips stakeholders with valuable insights for making informed decisions regarding security and risk management strategies.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing advanced tools and techniques to enhance cybersecurity posture and proactively mitigate potential threats. Through continuous monitoring and analysis, we can better safeguard our systems and data against evolving security risks.
